### Building From Source
If a supported binary for your OS is not found at the [releases page](https://github.com/profclems/glab/releases/latest), you can build from source:

   ```sh
   $ go version
   go version go1.14
   ```

   ```sh
   $ git clone https://github.com/cli/cli.git gh-cli
   $ cd gh-cli
   ```

3. Build the project

   ```
   $ make build
   ```

4. Move the resulting `bin/gh` executable to somewhere in your PATH

   ```sh
   $ sudo mv ./bin/gh /usr/local/bin/
   ```
   or
   ```sh
   $ sudo mv ./bin/gh /usr/bin/
   ```

4. Run `glab help` to check if it worked.


## Setting Up
