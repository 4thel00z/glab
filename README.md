GLab is an open source Gitlab Cli tool written in Go (golang) to help work seamlessly with Gitlab from the command line. Work with issues, merge requests, **watch running pipelines directly from your CLI** among other features. 
Inspired by `gh`, [the official GitHub CLI tool](https://github.com/cli/cli).

### Building From Source
If a supported binary for your OS is not found at the [releases page](https://github.com/profclems/glab/releases/latest), you can build from source:

#### Prerequisites for building from source are:
- `make`
- Go 1.13+

1. Verify that you have Go 1.13+ installed

   ```sh
   $ go version
   go version go1.14
   ```

   If `go` is not installed, follow instructions on [the Go website](https://golang.org/doc/install).

2. Clone this repository

   ```sh
   $ git clone https://github.com/profclems/glab.git
   $ cd glab
   ```
   If you have $GOPATH/bin or $GOBIN in your $PATH, you can just install with `make install` (install glab in $GOPATH/bin) and **skip steps 3 and 4**.

3. Build the project
   ```
   $ make
   ```

4. Move the resulting `bin/glab` executable to somewhere in your PATH

   ```sh
   $ sudo mv ./bin/glab /usr/local/bin/
   ```

4. Run `glab version` to check if it worked and `glab config init` to set up

## Authentication

Get a GitLab access token at https://gitlab.com/profile/personal_access_tokens or https://gitlab.example.com/profile/personal_access_tokens if self-hosted

- start interactive setup
```sh
$ glab auth login
```

- authenticate against gitlab.com by reading the token from a file
```sh
$ glab auth login --stdin < myaccesstoken.txt
```

- authenticate against a self-hosted GitLab instance by reading from a file
```sh
$ glab auth login --hostname salsa.debian.org --stdin < myaccesstoken.txt
```

- authenticate with token and hostname (Not recommended for shared environments)
```sh
$ glab auth login --hostname gitlab.example.org --token xxxxx
```

## Configuration

`glab` follows the XDG Base Directory [Spec](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html): global configuration file is saved at `~/.config/glab-cli`. Local configuration file is saved at the root of the working git directory and automatically added to `.gitignore`.

**To set configuration globally**

```sh
$ glab config set --global editor vim
```

**To set configuration for current directory (must be a git repository)**

```sh
$ glab config set editor vim
```

**To set configuration for a specific host**

Use the `--host` flag to set configuration for a specific host. This is always stored in the global config file with or without the `global` flag.

```sh
$ glab config set editor vim --host gitlab.example.org
```


## Environment Variables
  ```sh
  GITLAB_TOKEN: an authentication token for API requests. Setting this avoids being
  prompted to authenticate and overrides any previously stored credentials.
  Can be set in the config with 'glab config set token xxxxxx'

  GITLAB_URI or GITLAB_HOST: specify the url of the gitlab server if self hosted (eg: https://gitlab.example.com). Default is https://gitlab.com.

  REMOTE_ALIAS or GIT_REMOTE_URL_VAR: git remote variable or alias that contains the gitlab url.
  Can be set in the config with 'glab config set remote_alias origin'

  VISUAL, EDITOR (in order of precedence): the editor tool to use for authoring text.
  Can be set in the config with 'glab config set editor vim'

  BROWSER: the web browser to use for opening links.
  Can be set in the config with 'glab config set browser mybrowser'

  GLAMOUR_STYLE: environment variable to set your desired markdown renderer style
  Available options are (dark|light|notty) or set a custom style
  https://github.com/charmbracelet/glamour#styles
  
  NO_COLOR: set to any value to avoid printing ANSI escape sequences for color output. 
  ```
